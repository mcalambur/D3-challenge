          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare quality and Poverty levels</h2>
          <p>Healthcare in the US is an incredibly complex subject. There are several confounding factors that often get in the way of
            providing quality health out comes for patients. Unlike any other retail business in which there are exactly two players: The product manufacturer and the consumer, 
            there are many players in a given healthcare "consumption" decision including the Pharmaceuticals that manufacture the product, 
            The hospital system  or individual practicing physician who prescribe the product, and the Insurance who decides whether or not
            to cover the price of the product. And each of these players are driven by profit motives in these decisions.</p>

            <p> The one thing that is truly missing from the healthcare picture is the actual patient who is in need of the healthcare product.
              They often have the least say when they are the ones being impacted the most. If their lives aren't at stake then certainly 
              their wallets are. With the rising cost of healthcare in this country many policy experts ask the critical question of whois getting 
              left out becuase they can't afford their care. We have worked to try to visualize the problem by leveraging the Census and BRFSS 
              data to understand how healthcare is correlated with poverty levels. 
            </p>

            <p>As you can see in the plot above, there is a clear linear trend between poverty levels and healthcare provided. In layman's terms, 
              as you improve your poverty levels, we see a steady increase in the healthcare access. With such high prices from the pharma companies, 
              and insurance companies denying coverage on healthcare products, we can see folks in lower poverty levels are clearly getting left behind.
